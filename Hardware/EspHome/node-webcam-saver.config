##
# The idea behind this script, is to listen to a specific mqtt topic
# and when we receive a message on that topic, we activate a specific
# GPIO pin, which should in turn activate an LED.
#
# Future Updates: 
#   1. Add the ability to support success & failure with different LED Colors
#
# Hardware:
#   This sketch? was designed and tested using a NodeMCU v3 with a 220 ohm resister
#   and a Green LED connected to D1
